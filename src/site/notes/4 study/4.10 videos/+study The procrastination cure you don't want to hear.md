# The procrastination cure you don't want to hear

## consolidation, notes, key points

you often know exactly what you have to or want to do, and you want so badly for you to be able to do it... but you just can't bring yourself to do it, even with how hard you might internally want to.

'why is life set up this way'? you might ask. why is it that i only face this resistance when i think of doing things that are actually useful, beneficial, or that gives me fulfillment?

'wouldn't it be better if i just motivated and enjoyed doing these often difficult things?'

**there is one strategy that works every time for making you do things.**
it's very basic.
its not flattering.
its not the trick that everyone wants to work.
we don't want it to work. we want to find little tips and tricks and doohickies we can find that sound good and ones where we get the best of both worlds - reality and fantasy
but it does work. 'this strategy is nuclear.'

it's [[boredom\|boredom]].

it's also the problem.

your brain doesnt see objective entertainment values. only relative to other things.
so even though you would be pretty entertained doing the thing you actually want to do, there is something in your reach that is more entertaining on its own, so you brain views the thing that you want to do as inferior. *(your brain interprets things using contrasts)*

the issue is that you do have this backdoor to higher faux entertainment in your grasp, and your brain wants nothing to do with the main lower entertainment value thing. it sees a more shiny thing across the room.

the solution? eliminate all the backdoors.

don't let yourself reach for your phone by, you guessed it, making your phone hard to reach, hard to get to. do this with every distraction. isolate yourself from faux entertainment, and you will have nothing better to do than actually do what you want to do.

> [!reason and example]
> this is because humans *absolutely hate being bored*. left in solitary confinement, you would do anything, any activity provided to you, even if it hurts you. 
> **example**: experiment where college students were put in a room with nothing except an electrocuter for multiple hours. many shocked themselves because it was much preferred than anything else they could do.
