# I was denied a scholarship. That's why I started this.

## notes, consolidation, key points

three things you can't learn in any [[online courses\|online course]]
- [[inspiration\|inspiration]]
- [[motivation\|motivation]]
- [[happiness\|happiness]]

why?

there are (at least) four kinds of knowledge:
- knowing what?
- knowing why?
- knowing how?
- knowing where?
knowing knowledge is knowing what source a knowledge comes from, and understanding it in relation to that source.

### [[motivation\|motivation]] and [[2 zettels/discipline\|discipline]]:

which of these areas does [[motivation\|motivation]] fall? none of them.
motivation is a myth.

how to learn [[motivation\|motivation]]? learn [[2 zettels/discipline\|self discipline]].

# motivation comes from action
____

motivation comes from action; it is a reaction to action, and to get action [[2 zettels/2.10 entities/you\|you]] must make a start. making a start requires [[2 zettels/discipline\|discipline]].
'having discipline -> getting a start -> getting feedback => motivation'

what if the feedback is bad (really bad)?? distinguish [[constructive critisism\|helpful criticism]] from useless criticism.
learn from the helpful (constructive) criticism that you can act on using continuing [[2 zettels/discipline\|discipline]]. then you will improve and feedback will get better. eventually.

### [[inspiration\|inspiration]] and [[2 zettels/discipline\|discipline]]:

inspiration is widely [[misunderstanding\|misunderstood]]. it is typically thought of as an [[enlightenment\|enlightenment]] of a [[creative\|creative]] mind which people have to wait upon. 'till the muse kisses them'

inspiration is something you strive for, not wait.
you gain inspiration by emmersing yourself, engaging with and absorbing ideas. 

[[analogy\|analogy]]: inspiration is like a fishing net that catches ideas; the bigger the net, the better.
waiting for inspiration is like casting a single fishing line and dozing.

craft your net to be as wide as possible. build it and the inspiration will come.

> fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp."
> [[william somerset maugham\|william somerset maugham]]

if [[2 zettels/2.10 entities/you\|you]] want inspiration, make the [[2 zettels/discipline\|disciplined]] choice of engaging with [[information\|information]].

motivation is the want, the need, the [[desire\|desire]], to **continue** doing something.
inspiration is the [[idea\|ideas]], the [[2 zettels/knowledge\|knowledge]], the enginuious novelty **injected** into what is being done.
both require [[+study discipline\|+study discipline]] as the source. ([[I was denied a scholarship. That's why I started this.#motivation - discipline\|start the process of both, and both will come.]])

### happiness

happiness is a state of mind.

and, happiness is a biproduct. (of [[4 study/4.10 videos/+study I was denied a scholarship. That's why I started this.#^c61915\|the actual product]].)

'
in [[german\|german]], the word "gl√ºck" has three different meanings.
- [[luck\|luck]]
- [[happiness\|happiness]]
- [[success\|success]]
'
this equating of these three definitions are a symptom of one of the most common human [[fallacy\|fallacies]]: that [[success\|success]] is the thing that *causes* [[happiness\|happiness]]. people [[strive\|strive]] for [[success\|success]] because they see a [[idols\|public few]] who have achieved it, but they can't see the [[vast majority\|millions of others]] who [[failure\|failed]] to achieve the same [[success\|success]].

[[luck\|luck]] is widely understood to beget no [[control\|control]] to humans. sometimes we are lucky and sometimes we are unlucky; luck is a [[description\|description]] more than a [[property\|property]]. nevertheless, we can try to put ourselves in more situations where a lucky thing might happen, by being more [[active\|active]] and [[being in the now\|present]].

in a similar way [[success\|success]] is never gauranteed. we can increase the chances of us achieving [[success\|success]], but we can never fully [[control\|control]] our [[outcome\|outcome]], only [[2 zettels/the r factor\|steer]] us in that direction.

the only thing that is still fully in our grasp is happiness.

it is always availiable for us to steer ourselves in a way which we are still happy with our lives the whole way through it, no matter our level of success.

''there is **no** path *to*' happiness. but there are paths *of* happiness that you can take
(take them!) via [[2 zettels/discipline\|discipline]]. get on those happy paths!

happiness is a biproduct of doing things that you value. what makes a path of happiness is making things and doing things of value to you.
{ #c61915}


this can be 

### go out and do stuff!!!
do the things! get down to business!
remember, [[2 zettels/discipline\|discipline]] is just doing the [[2 zettels/choice\|choices]] that keep you on a path where you are happy!
