# The PROBLEM with Active Recall and Spaced Repetition (Truth Behind Studying Smarter)

## consolidation, notes, key points

- [[studying|studying]] is not the same as [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/learning|learning]]
- Studying is physical while learning is a cognitive process
- Studying techniques that produce low learning are time consuming
- Different techniques invoke different levels of learning
- Memory going into [[longterm memory|longterm memory]] is called [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/encoding (learning)|encoding (learning)]]
- Level of encoding determines a significant amount of retention
- Retrieving memory from longterm memory to [[working memory|working memory]] in order to use it for applications is called [[retrieval (learning)|retrieval (learning)]]
- Information that is in working memory instead of long term is forgotten very quickly
- Active recall and spaced repetition work through adjusting the forgetting curve only through repetition
- This is only working on retrieval aspect of memory only (This doesn't help with encoding)
- Encoding would reduce the knowledge decay of the [[forgetting curve|forgetting curve]] to reduce the number of repetitive revisions and relearning sessions needed, therefore saving lots of time
- Proper encoding also makes learning more enjoyable and engaging
- Techniques that cause poor encoding and use low [[cognitive load|cognitive load]] load are called passive techniques
- A sign of [[passive learning|passive learning]] is sleepiness
- Techniques that cause high learning through appropriate cognitive load are called active learning techniques. There are many.
- Low retention studying due to poor encoding is unsustainable to fix with repetition based techniques
- Encoding involves cognitive load
- Cognitive load feels uncomfortable and confusing
- This is partially why so few students use encoding techniques
- Another reason retrieval techniques like active recall and spaced repetition are so common is due to the Dunning Kruger effect where low knowledge causes high confidence
- This combines with success bias whereyou don't hear about the failure stories
- This then combines with availability bias where we define legitimacy by how common we are exposed to it
- This creates a spiral of unknowledgeable people creating videos about common techniques that are not as effective as they claim, making it more available, increasing its perceived legitmacy
- Considering that encoding is naturally difficult, this makes encoding techniques very uncommonly talked about
