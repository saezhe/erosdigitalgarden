# an introduction to potential roommates at [[5 spaces/5.20 clemson/5.20. clemson atlas/-5.20 clemson space|clemson]]

i'm [[2 zettels/2.10 entities/@ashby sharp|ashby]]! i'm a [[computer science|computer science]] major and [[3 logs/2022.07/2022.07.04 coming out|trans girl]] thats obsessed with [[math|math]], logic, [[2 zettels/2. zettels atlas/language moc|language]], [[2 zettels/2. zettels atlas/music moc|music]], and everything related to those. i'm a geek thats not into sports. i am easily distracted and i zone out sometimes, although i hate it when i do.

i have been in several clubs in highschool, primarily in a FIRST robotics competition ([[FRC|FRC]]) team as the lead programmer. i have also been in academic team, theatre club, marching band, njrotc, and student council over the years.

i love thinking of new ways of seeing the world. i see language as a way to share these ways. i also love how emotions can be evoked in artforms like music, and i make music casually, and am into microtonal/xenharmonic [[music theory|music theory]].

i play some pc games like [[minecraft|minecraft]], terraria, [[factorio|factorio]], along with jackbox style party games or cards against humanity. i don't play fps games alot other than rust, but it's fine if you do.

i stand by everything in the bill of rights, including the first and second amendments, but i tend to stay out of [[politics|politics]] in general, though i find it interesting.

my class schedule will be mostly morning classes.

i'm attracted to women, so i'm [[lesbian|lesbian]], but i am willing to have a [[platonic|platonic]] relationship with anybody i care a lot about.

i'm [[agnostic|agnostic]]; i can't know if there is a supreme being that exists or not, let alone who/what they are.

i get depressed sometimes about typical trans things, but that's lessening and will continue to lessen. Other than that, i have felt depressed whenever i had a high workload to deal with. i want to keep both of us in a good mental state as much as possible, so i hope we can keep each other organised, on task, and open about things so we can talk through them.

Elaboration on [[lifestyle|lifestyle]] questions:

i want our room to be comfortable but not distracting.

i feel like parties should be hosted in rooms other than ours, but [[friends at clemson|friends]] are fine to come for visits. i should have existing friends over only every once in a while.

i aspire to go to bed early and wake up early. i really hope i can find someone who either also wants to get enough rest every day dependably, or is a natural early bird. i hope to sleep from a little before eight to a little before five, and sleep in however much is needed.

i want to keep things tidy, and i try to keep everything as organised as i can, even though its difficult for me.

Generally, if an item is important to me or expensive, i don't want anyone using it without my supervision, but most things i am happy to lend to or share to use in the room. All of this depends on trust as well.

i don't smoke or vape, and i will not room with someone who does.

The temperature i'm most comfortable at is 22C or 71-72F, but it really depends on the humidity level. in general, somewhere in the range of plus or minus a few degrees from 70 is fine.

i hope we can become fine friends this year, but the bottom line is that we are living with each other, so we have to learn to live with each other well. Accepting boundaries and respecting each other's lifestyles and identities is critical to both our sanity and wellbeing. i'd love to chat and exchange contacts.
