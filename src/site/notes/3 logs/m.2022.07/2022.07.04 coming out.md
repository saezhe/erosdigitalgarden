# coming out:
____
i'm going by a new name, [[erosaezheneia alememe\|saezhe]], cause i hate my given first name. you will understand why in a moment.

( im coming out as transgender )

## the jist:

i'm more of a girl than a boy.

and im not talking about biologically, but about me as a person aesthetically.

my living breathing body is what it has been, but my thinking feeling human person, my brain, and my personality is female in comparison. that's all.

so, if you want to put a label on that, then i'm transgender.

i only use that label to approximate what i feel, but i dont like using labels in general because they allow people to stereotype me.

## the request

it makes me very uncomfortable when you use male pronouns to refer to me, or just refer(ence) to me as a boy. this includes my first name

i would much prefer using female pronouns when talking to and about me: she and her ( or they and them )

and talking and referring to me in general, refer to me as a girl ( please ðŸ¥º )

other nicknames i thought of :) any of these or one you think up and i like

### nicks for ashbie:

{ free space ðŸ™‚ }

## humans being humans

its OK if you make mistakes, that's what humans do best, and you will learn from them, so as long as your trying and improving, is all i ask.

### questions?

ask please, there are some things that are personal to me but for most things i will try and answer. i've done some research to try and take the load off of you but i also cant remember anything i try to off the top of my head
