<[[2 zettels/bibasic decimal system|new version]]>
# bibasic decimal system (old version):

i use this system i made up to index my [[2 zettels/zettelkasten|zettels]] in my [[$service obsidian]] vault.

## explanation:

ids are strings of numbers that consist of atoms of two digits each.
if the first digit in an id is 0 (it usually is) it is not written, causing an odd number of digits in all.
an even number means the first digit was not left out.

examples (commas are only for intelligability purposes):
`## [title]`
`0# [title]` <=> `# [title]`
`##,## [title]` <=> `#### [title]`
`0#,## [title]` <=> `#,## [title]` => `### [title]`/ `0### [title]`
`##,##,## [title]` <=> `###### [title]`
... and so on...

these id codes can be put in names of folders or files. [^1]
important files usually have a `+` put before the code to sort them out of the other files when sorting alphabetically.

the general pattern is `[prefix][pilot (# or ##)][address (any number of pairs like these: ##)`
where `#` is any of these digits: `0123456789`

## extended system:

the `!` prefix is used as a prefix when coded pages are yet to be made, but when being made will create themselves in the default zettel folder, which they do not belong inside.

the pilot can be `00`, and by that differentiating it from other pilots it allows for the use of additional number to expand how many pilots are possible.

**example choices of what might be used:**
two digit  (nonviolate of current system): `0001`-`0099`
three digits (extension of current system): `00001`-`00999`
**(same written leaving the front `0` off):**
two digit  (nonviolate of current system): `001`-`099`
three digits (extension of current system): `0001`-`0999`

## extras:

this is compatible with many bases, but one base i'd really want to use with this is [[seximal|base six]], my favorite base!
