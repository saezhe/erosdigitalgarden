# encoding (learning):

the proces of learning something that is integrating the learned pattern in to [[2 zettels/long term memory|longterm memory]]

The [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/method|methods]] for achieving encoding of knowledge is extremely complex, and there is a lot to learn about how it is best achieved.

## orders of learning
[[deep processing|deep processing]]

encoding happens better at higher orders of learning. higher orders means that the brain can organize [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|concepts]] in a way so that thye know their eay around and can understand their relation and function.

things are usually pretty logical, so they can fit in reasonably in your brains [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|conception]].

## blooms taxonomy
a way of understanding orders of learning

![[$file 2022.06.29.15.34.17 blooms taxonomy.png|$file 2022.06.29.15.34.17 blooms taxonomy.png]]
### levels:
1. remember: recall facts and stuff
2. understand: explain [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|concepts]]
3. apply: use info in a different situation
4. analyse: find hidden connections between [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|concepts]]
5. evaluate: justify decisions with proof
6. create: produce novel works

understanding is still isolated, you want it to be connected.

you have to encode something *while* its in working memory.

1. as soon as possible jump to higher learning.

how do things relate in the grand scheme of things? what is their meaning as an atomic part of the whole?

## solo taxonomy
(idk what these names are)

model of levels of relationship in the mind between information.

![[$file 2022.06.29.15.33.47 solo taxonomy.png|$file 2022.06.29.15.33.47 solo taxonomy.png]]

### levels:

1. prestructural: no connection or organisation of info.
2. unistructure: simple connections but no noted importance to those connections between info.
3. multistructure: connections and importance of connections between info *are* made, but overall meaning is missed.
4. relational: parts are synthesised with overall meaning of the subject or [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|concept]].
5. extended abstract: the [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|conceptual]] structure glob is connected and generalised with other subjects and [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|concepts]], allows for prediction and evaluation.

relate info to each other, and relate info to the bigger picture.

set your focus on higher orders of thinking first, and once you are doing that, the brain organises and memorises (do the lower levels) automatically for you.

for this to work when doing notes, you need to increase your [[cognitive load|cognitive load]] by not writing for a while thinking about the [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|concepts]] that you are hearing, then when have everything [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|conceptualised]] inti a neat packet and you are ready, put down and explain that packet of [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|concept]] on your notes. the point is that you are actively doing the work of making sense of the knowledge yourself.

if the connections become overburdening you, then try this beforehand: look for how to apply smaller portions to get a better hang of them first before attempting to connect them to other [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/-2.20 concepts moc|concepts]].
