# collecting knowledge vs building knowledge
---

collecting, [[2 zettels/2.20 concepts/learning|learning]], [[studying|studying]] existing [[knowledge|knowledge]] gives you access to *so many things* that *you couldn't have thought of yourself*, but the **problems** that everyone *[[1 inbox/taking things for granted|takes for granted]]* will be instilled in you as well.

building knowledge *by yourself* **to the level of existing knowledge bases** *is very tedious*, and requires a lot of mindpower, [[work|work]], effort. you *will not find* some answers to **problems that are already solved** in the **wider world**.

*none* of these methods will be [[success|successful]] on their own. one needs to participate in *a mix of both* and **balance them**.
	different aspects are ignored in each method, and participating in both should help you while supposed to be filling in the gaps in standard public knowledge;
>	unfortunately, *both systems* are often **opposed** to accepting **new ideas** that fill in gaps that they either *[[1 inbox/taking things for granted|take for granted]]* or already **have other options** for.

the **wider world** can be an *indespensible* source of [[2 zettels/2.30 collections/wisdom|wisdom]] from problems that people have **had in the past**. it's very *beneficial* for you if you **[[learn from other peoples mistakes and not yours|learn from their mistakes and not yours]]**.
