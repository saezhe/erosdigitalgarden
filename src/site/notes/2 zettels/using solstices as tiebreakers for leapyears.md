# [[2 zettels/using solstices as tiebreakers for leapyears\|using solstices as tiebreakers for leapyears]]:

a way we can produce a perfectly synchronised and indisputable calendar, with these *three easy steps*:
- pick a point of longitude on the earth to represent a crossing over point. (think prime meridian or international date line, (but better).)
- every year should start on a solstice (and the tiebreaker is whether or not the solstice occurs when the sun is on one side of the crossing over point or the other)
- the actual calendar weeks and months should be regular and start on a specific day of the week each year, resulting in the remaining days being padding for the year and will be part of the new year holidays, which the leap days would naturally fall into (and no mod \# of years calculations needed!).

we could also start the year on intervals of a week and have leap weeks, but i am opposed to that idea if we can do leap days instead, still influenced by when .

conventions needed:
- crossing over longitude on earth:
	- international date line, prime meridian, or my favorite: [[the line of longitude with the least land area\|the line of longitude with the least land area]].
- which sun event:
	- winter solstice for northern hemisphere / summer solstice for southern hemisphere
	- winter solstice for southern hemisphere / summer solstice for northern hemisphere (i personally prefer this one for arbitrary reasons)
